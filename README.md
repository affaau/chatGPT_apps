Usage example of ask.bat in Windows:
1. To make a request once.
Type ask, follow with the question
$ ask who is the CEO of google

Sundar Pichai is the current CEO of Google.

2. To keep apps open for multiple requests.
Just type ask
$ ask

3. Type 'Q' to quit.
> q
Bye!

To run python script once,
$ python GPT_apps.py "embrace your qwuestion within quotation"
> (type yr question after this prompt)

To keeps apps open for multiple requests, simply
$ python GPT_app.py
'>' prompt will show up again after every question, waiting for next one 

Type 'q' or 'Q' to quit the program.

Have fun!
